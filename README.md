# Causal Impact of the 2025 F5 Networks Cybersecurity Breach  
### Difference-in-Differences Analysis of Stock Market Reaction

This project analyzes the financial impact of the **October 2025 cyber breach at F5 Networks (FFIV)** using **causal inference techniques** — specifically a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** model and a **Difference-in-Trends** robustness test.

Because real stock markets cannot be A/B tested, DiD provides a credible way to estimate what portion of the price impact was caused by the breach itself.

---

## Project Goal
Estimate how the public breach announcement affected **F5 Networks’ daily stock returns**, compared to:

- Industry competitors  
- Broader market benchmarks  

The focus is on identifying **causal impact**, not just correlation.

---

## Data Sources

All stock data comes from **Yahoo Finance** pulled using the `yfinance` API.

**Time Window**
- Start: **2025-04-18**  
- End: **2025-12-12**  
- Event Date: **2025-10-16**

**Tickers Used**

| Group | Ticker | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Treated | **FFIV** | F5 Networks |
| Competition | AKAM | Akamai |
|            | NET | Cloudflare |
|            | CSCO | Cisco |
| Benchmarks | SPY | S&P 500 ETF |
|            | VTI | Total Market ETF |

## Methodology

### 1. Compute Daily Returns  

returns ~ treated + post + treated_post
Where:

- **treated = 1** for FFIV  
- **post = 1** on/after event date  
- **treated_post = treated × post**  
- The coefficient on `treated_post` is the **causal effect**  

### 3. Validity Checks  
To ensure a credible estimate:

- ✔ **Parallel Trends Check**
- ✔ **Placebo Test (fake event date)**
- ✔ **Difference-in-Trends robustness model**

---

## Key Findings

### Main Result  
The DiD estimate shows a **~9.5% additional drop** in F5’s daily returns after the breach:
treated_post = -0.0951 (p < 0.001)

This means:

F5 underperformed competitors by **about 9–10% due to the breach**, beyond normal market movement.

### Additional observations
- `treated` not significant → FFIV behaved similarly to peers before the event  
- `post` slightly negative → market dipped modestly overall  
- Placebo effect = no significance → supports causal validity

## Why This Matters

Cybersecurity failures have **material financial impact**.  
This project demonstrates how data science + causal inference can support:

- Risk management  
- Cyber impact assessment  
- Investor relations  
- Executive reporting  
- Strategic decision-making

## Future Extensions

- Add volatility + volume impact  
- Use intraday prices for precision  
- Consider a Bayesian structural time-series model  
- Expand competitor set using clustering
